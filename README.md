run with either 1 launch argument being the directory of the music to convert (no sub-directory searching)
or with no launch argument and type/paste in the directory after

it will create a folder in the out folder with the songs converted to wav and with a .cue file

import the .cue file into Duckstation and play some vib-ribbon (need to have set up vib-ribbon to accept a custom cd first)
